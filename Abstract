Accurate classification of brain tumor is an important step for early intervention. In 1
recent years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic systems are being utilized to help automate 2
the process and provide more objective and fast diagnosis. The work introduces an enhanced AI- 3
based architecture for improved brain tumor classification. We introduce a hybrid architecture 4
that integrates vision transformer (ViT) and deep neural networks to create an ensemble classifier, 5
resulting in a more robust brain tumor classification framework. The analysis pipeline begins with 6
preprocessing and data normalization Then, three feature sets are extracted for the classification. The 7
first is a descriptor for texture features using higher-order texture feature descriptors . Additionally, 8
local deeper features of the brain images are extracted using an optimized convolutional neural 9
networks (CNN) architecture. Finally, ViT-derived features are also integrated due to its ability to 10
handle dependencies across larger distances, while being less sensitive to data argumentation. The 11
extracted features are then weighted and fused and fed to a machine learning classifier for final 12
classification of brain MRIs. The proposed weighted ensemble architecture has been evaluated on 13
both publicly-available and locally-collected brain MRIs of four classes using various metrics. The 14
results showed that leveraging the benefits of individual components of the proposed architecture 15
lead to improved performance using ablation studies.
