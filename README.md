# A-Hybrid-Learning-Architecture-for-Improved-Brain-Tumor-Recognition
This work has introduced a hybrid architecture for multi-classification of brain tumors 319 using MR images. The analysis pipeline integrated three learning modules to extract 320 texture (radiomic) and deep hidden features from the brain images, by a weighing scenario, to form a rich feature vector for tumor classification.
